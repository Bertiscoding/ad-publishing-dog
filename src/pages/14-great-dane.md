## Understanding the Great Dane Breed

Before diving into training techniques, it's crucial to understand the unique traits of Great Danes. Known for their gentle nature, intelligence, and imposing size, Great Danes are loyal family members. Understanding these characteristics is the foundation for a successful training approach.
